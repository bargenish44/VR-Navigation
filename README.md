# VR-Navigation
## My final project

VR-Navigation is a tool that creates a VR world with the possibility to travel between scenes, it works generically by getting a JSON file as an input.

The project includes two separate systems:

1. The first system is called the "Json Generator",

   Its purpose is to be a helper tool for creating the JSON that represents the VR map.

2. The second system is called "VRNavigation", 

   This system is a mobile application that gets a JSON file as an input and builds the VR world based on this JSON file.

   The application collects statistical information about the user's path and exports the data to a CSV file.

This project is part of a big research project at Ariel University, Bar-Ilan University, and The Israel-Japan Friendship Society.
